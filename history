us check what everyone has done until the current time and it will make easier
to detect any points os risk.

In this first commit, I made the necessary changes to the EPOS system accepts
the driver from the AdaFruit. The main changes were:

- I transform all variables from 8, 16 bits to 32 bits
- I commented the print command, since the the uart serial doesn't support this operation
- I changed the 'available' method of the SerialSoftware to it's equivalent in the EPOS: 'get'
- The configuration of the serial at the 'begin' method can have some problems, because I used
the values for data, parity and stop bits from the test and I don't what they mean.

The version of this code is compiling.

Our new changes are basically:

- We created a main file based on examples that we find on repositories.
The name of the file is "main_fingerprint.cc"
- We adapted the code to follow the standard used by the EPOS. 
- We adapted the Adafruit library using the EPOS uart, to read and send data
through the serial.
- We adapted the print from the serial, to the 'cout' of the EPOS.
